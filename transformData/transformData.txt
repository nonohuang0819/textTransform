ransitional justice scenarios are where a society is moving from war to peace or from authoritarianism to 24... Akey goal of
ansitional justice is to balance atoning for past 25. ___ of human rights with creating the conditions for social and political

stability in the future, and this requires avoiding forms of “victor’s justice” whereby one system of __ 26. _ is simply replaced
ith another. Questions related to transitional justice, then, are not merely about justice, but about justice and prudence: not merely
hom to punish and by what authority, but to what ends. These ends are achieved primarily via the recognition of wrongdoings and
ictims, andthe _-27.__ of civic trust. It is questionable, therefore, whether the emphasis on legality and punishment should be
¢ primary mechanism of transitional justice, or that more emphasis should be placed on education, identities, and culture. excerpt

Abalone tops the list of the most___28.__ seafood in Chinese cuisine, and fresh South African abalone are always the first

xtinction.

“The South African wild abalone are heavier, and they are better than the farmed Japanese and Australian ones in terms of

fresh flavor and texture,” said Lau, general manager of Ah Yat Abalones restaurant in Hong Kong. “Our fresh South African
balone are all imported through __30.__ channels. The smuggled ones are usually dried and rare in Hong Kong.”

The illicit abalone trade has been gathering significant attention from __31.__ combating wildlife trafficking, who believe

On November 11, 2019, volunteers planted 11 million trees in Turkey as part of a government-backed 32. _called
[Breath for the Future. In one northern city, the tree-planting campaign set the Guinness World Record for the most saplings planted
in one hour in a single location: 303,150. “By planting millions of young trees, the nation is working to fostera new, 33.
isreen Turkey,” Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said when he kicked off the project in Ankara.

Less than three months later, up to 90 percent of the saplings were__34._, the Guardian reported. The trees were planted
iat the wrong time and there wasn’t enough rainfall to support the saplings, the head of the country’s agriculture and forestry trade

In the past two decades, mass tree-planting campaigns like this one have gained popularity as a salve for many of our modern

hat’s not to like about trees? They suck up carbon emissions naturally while providing resources for wildlife and humans — and
ey’re even nice to look at. It sounds like a win-win-win.
There’s just one problem: These campaigns often don’t work, and sometimes they can even fuel deforestation. In one recent
study in the journal Nature, for example, researchers examined long-term restoration efforts in northern India, a country that has
invested huge amounts of money into planting over the last 50 years. The authors found “no evidence” that planting offered

assage B: Questions 40-42
‘Cancel culture’ has recently become the focus of heated public debates and controversies in countries around the world.

riven primarily by Twitter and other social media, cancel culture has become a common phrase referring to practices of
ublicizing, shaming, and shutting down individuals who are perceived to exhibit offensive, unethical, politically incorrect, or
armful behavior.

Besides social media, the phenomenon of cancel culture has also penetrated universities through events such as speaker
ancellations and campaigns in college campuses that demand the ‘cancelling’ of artworks, monuments or buildings associated with
acism, colonialism, and sexism. These events have raised debates on campuses around the world concerning the ethical issues
laround the morality and motivations of cancel culture as well as the political implications of cancel culture, especially in relation to
free speech. On the one hand, there are those who argue that calling out discriminatory behavior is a good thing because it helps the
vulnerable deal with perpetrators. On the other hand, there are also those who criticize cancel culture for stifling free speech and
lopen debate, suggesting that cancel culture ends up being a kind of a performative spectacle that enables those doing the calling out
to feel morally superior. These critics question whether the practice of ‘cancelling’ really succeeds in addressing very real, structural,
land pressing issues of social injustice.

The phenomenon of cancel culture is much more complex than a binary scheme between those who argue for or against it.
One way of seeing this phenomenon is to situate it in the broader terrain of ‘culture wars’ and how to teach this issue in schools. In
other words, a key question for educators to reflect on is: How can the phenomenon of cancel culture be engaged pedagogically in
tways that identify and challenge social inequalities, rather than getting stuck on cancelling individuals, leading to a toxic culture
fien filled with dogmatism and disillusion? The intention is not to dismiss the transformative possibilities of cancel culture in the
ght against injustice. What may be the fundamental issue in debates around cancel culture is not so much the threat to free speech,
ut rather the ethical willingness for taking a restorative approach — an approach that does not reproduce the ostracization and social
xclusion of perpetrators but considers how to reconnect people in their collective efforts towards co-creating a better world.

assage D: Questions 47-50

On September 18, 2021, the privately funded spaceflight Inspiration4 splashed down safely in the Atlantic after a successful
ree days orbiting Earth. Amid breathless press coverage of the event, journalists struggled to find the right words—and not just
ecause the spectacle of spaceflight often defies description. Rather, no one seemed sure of what to call the Inspiration4 crew.
Onboard Inspiration4 were four people, none of whom are a professional astronaut in the traditional sense. Whether they’re called
‘amateur astronauts,” “civilian crew,” “space tourists” or just plain old “astronauts,” though, it seemed like everyone agreed on the
akeaway message of Inspiration4: the fact that these four individuals had left Earth on a privately funded flight meant that a new
va had begun, one in which “anyone” could go to space. But is that really what the flight of Inspiration4 means?

The recent rash of billionaire-funded launches has raised the idea that spaceflights that are funded and crewed privately are
aking space more “accessible.” In the case of Inspiration4 and other recent private spaceflights, it is true that they are providing
ccess to space in the most literal sense of “access”: they have ferried people who are not part of any state astronaut corps to space.
at for most people, the word “accessible” doesn’t just mean being able to go somewhere; something being “accessible” suggests
hat it has become attainable to people for whom it might not have been otherwise, specifically by breaking barriers to their
articipation.

Looking at the billionaire-funded civilian flights thus far—not just Inspiration4 but also the recent flights of Jeff Bezos and
ichard Branson—one notes that the crews have been drawn largely from a demographic that faces few barriers: wealthy,
able-bodied, cisgender white men. As for the civilian astronauts who aren’t billionaires, they tend to be people who are eminently
qualified to go to space already. For example, Sian Proctor, the accomplished geoscientist and educator who piloted the Inspiration4
ission, was previously a finalist for NASA’s astronaut corps. Wally Funk, who finally reached space at the age of 82 alongside
ezos, had excelled at the battery of tests administered to astronaut candidates during the Mercury program in the 1960s. At the
ime, however, astronauts were also required to have been military test pilots, which effectively barred women from the job. Even
Chris Sembroski, who received his seat on Inspiration4 as a gift from an unnamed friend who had originally won it in Inspiration4’s
harity raffle for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, would have an advantage in becoming an astronaut through the traditional
‘oute: he served in the U.S. Air Force and graduated with a degree in professional aeronautics from Embry-Riddle University after
eaving active-duty military service. Of the Inspiration4 crew, only Hayley Arceneaux, the 29-year old physicians’ assistant and
cancer survivor who flew as the mission’s medical officer, would not have qualified under NASA’s current requirements because of
er prosthesis.

The narrative that billionaire-funded spaceflight is making space more accessible is not true beyond these specific, individual
cases, however. If one argues that state-run astronaut selection processes are gatekeeping access to space, then billionaires selecting
crews (including themselves) only substitutes an even less transparent arbiter of access in place of a national space agency. In a
arger sense, today’s billionaires not only inherited but continue to actively create a world rife with inequity—including barriers of
